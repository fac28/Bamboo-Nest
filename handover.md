* What are you building?
     * We are building a marketplace for users to rent, buy or sell pre-loved baby items locally.
* Why are you building it?
     * To give users a sustainable way to buy and sell baby items and to stop unnecessary waste. 

## üìô Project scope¬†
* What are you¬†not¬†building?
    * We are not building an app that has a payment system, or a webchat for users to communicate.
* How did you decide what features were important?
    * We spoke frequently with the product owner and refined what thought was most important based on what would create a MVP that achieved the product owner's core goals of a site where users could upload items and reach out to other users to get more information.
    * We conducted user research and user testing and asked for feedback over what features they would find most useful, and what they would expect from an MVP.
    * We re-prioritised whilst building 1. to ensure we met our user stories and 2. to build a product that was scalable and could be handed over to our product owner at the end of the project. 
## üëâ Project plan¬†
* How are you going to structure your sprints?
    * Sprints will be 1 week long with each day beginning and ending with a standup.
    * We will be using Miro to plan the build and create an overview of the product.
    * We will use the GitHub project kanban for track our velocity. 
* What order are you going to build in?
    * We will create a Next.js project and set up our database on Supabase, and then begin with the global layout for each page.
    * After this we will create the routes for each page and build the components and utils necessary for each page, with the aim of creating components that can be adapated to diferrent pages and layouts.
    * Alongside this we will tackle authentication and aim to style using Tailwind whilst building.
    
* How did user research inform your plan?
    * It made us rethink the flow through the site, and consider how a user with no pre-knowledge of the product would approach the site.
    * We realised we were unknowingly designing our app with assumptions over how a user would intereact with the site.
    * For example, a call to action on the landing page to sign up didn't make sense when the user didn't know what the product was for.
      
## üíΩ Requirement analysis¬†
* How will you ensure your project is accessible to as many users as possible
    * Clear design and layout to avoid overcrowding and confusion.
    * A footer and navigation bar to allow the user to access diferrent parts of the site through one point.
    * A return back one page button to take the user back a step.
    * We implemented semantic HTML and used aria labels were possible and tested tabbing through the site.

* Are there any legal or regulatory requirements you should consider?
    * Right to privacy - GDPR
    * Laws surrounding Indecent and Prohibited Images of Children.

## Project learnings¬†
* Did your team work effectively?  
    * We adapted how we approached issues as we went, and 1. began breaking down issues into smaller chunks, and 2. worked on single issue branches.
    * We were realistic with how much we could achieve in the timespan, and prioritised which extra features we would tackle should there be time.
* What would you do differently next time?
    * Planned the way the user would buy or rent an item from an earlier stage.

## Research and findings¬†
- What did you find out from user testing?
    - Users want to be able to interact with a fair amount of the site before creating an account.
    - Users don't see image quality on product listings as a priority.
    - Users care about simplicity and taking as few steps as possible to list an item.

## Project outcomes¬†
- What features would you prioritise to build next?
    - In-app messaging/communication.
    - In-app payments.
    - Consider the logisitics for payments and setting availability when renting an item.
    - A way for users to share the location of an item (whilst protecting a user's exact address)
    
- Was the project a success?
    - It was a good proof of concept, but a good chunk of time needs to be put towards the rental side of the product.
- Software Development Lifecycle stages¬†


## üó∫Ô∏è Planning¬†
* What roles did your team take on?
    * ü¶ô James - Scrum Facilitator
        * Responsible for project board, liaising with the product owner and removing blockers for the team
    * ü¶õ Dylan - QA & Testing
        * Insist on clean legible code
        * Ensure that the app has appropriate test coverage
        * Know when & to set up mock test where appropriate
    * ü¶õ Issy - UX & Design
        * Advocate for the user
        * Create a style guide
        * Ensure regular attention is given to thorough documentation
        * Ensure completion of handover documentation for the Product Owner
    * üêÉ Yuqing - DevOps
        * File structure / Next boilerplate
        * Lint + prettier + husky
        * Vercel deploy
        * Debugging deployment issues
        * Supabase project setup
     
* Having these roles was helpful, 1. it meant we knew how to prioritise tickets, 2. it gave people ownership over certain tasks, 3. it ensured we also got stuck into any task and helped out where was needed - no task was solely one roles.

## Analysis¬†
- What might be the intended and unintended consequences of building this product?
  - It might make people consider how the environmental impact of buying baby products first-hand.
  - It may make people take a more sustainable approach to interacting with the baby product market.
  - It may encourage people to rent out items until needed again, which they would have otherwise disposed of. 

## üé≠ Design¬†
- How did you plan a user experience?
    - We created a detail mockup on Figma with prototyping to mimic the user journey.
    - We also used Miro to help us think about our user stories, and the interactions between the front-end and back-end of our product.
  
- What technical decisions did you make?
    - We decided to use Next14, Supabase, and Typescript to improve the readability and robustness of our codes.
- Relational or non-relational or no DB
    - We chose a relational database (postgres in Supabase) which is the standard choice for an e-commerce project.
- Self-hosted or platform-as-a-service
     - We used Paas Supabase for Auth, DB, bucket storage.
- Frontend first vs DB first
    - We designed a schema for our database first, and started thinking about how we would query the database to retrieve information before working on the front-end. 

# Technical Specification
### Supabase: 
- Purpose and Contents: Supabase serves as our centralised storage for databases, user authentication details, and image assets (stored in a specific bucket).
- Environment Variables: To access environment variables in Supabase, refer to the .env.example.
- Authentication: Currently, authentication is integrated through Supabase, limited to email-based logins.
- TypeScript Integration: Types are systematically exported for TypeScript usage directly from Supabase.

### Vercel: 
- Deployment: The project is actively deployed at bamboo-nest.vercel.app, with continuous updates.

### CICD
- Code Quality Assurance: We enforce code standards using Prettier & Lint, triggered on pre-commit hooks managed by Husky. Detailed configurations can be found in the Husky configuration file.

### env variables
- A .env.example file is provided in the repository for guidance on setting up necessary environment variables.

### Google Maps API
- the product owner will need to set up their own google maps dev account to get new google Maps API credentials. The documentation for that is here: https://developers.google.com/maps
- May need ¬£¬£ if after a number of requests

### Design & CSS
- Frameworks Used: Our UI is built using the Next UI component library, augmented with custom components crafted using Tailwind CSS for flexible styling.
