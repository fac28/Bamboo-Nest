### Build
- At the beginning of each build week we decided what features to work on. Split each feature in to small issues aiming to ensure everything was at most E3.
- Everyone assigned themselves work ensuring active tickets were marked as such.
- At the ened of the week we reflected on how the week had gone. Made sure issues had been properly labeled with estimations and actuals.

## Project Outcomes
## Future Improvements
- add location features: Filter by distance etc
- add payment processing
- add in app communication
